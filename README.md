# Skylar Kramer's first Portfolio Page! (Module 2 Challenge)

## Description

I've created this portfolio page in order to show off my best work in an easy to read and enjoy format.

In addition, I have learned a lot about CSS styling and HTML structure. Though over time, I hope to further refine the styling to condense it a bit!
